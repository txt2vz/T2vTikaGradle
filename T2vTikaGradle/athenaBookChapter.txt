Abstract The analysis of potentially large volumes of crowd-sourced and social
media data is central to meeting the requirements of the Athena project. Here, we
discuss the various stages of the pipeline process we have developed, including acquisition
of the data, analysis, aggregation, filtering and structuring. We highlight
the challenges involved when working with unstructured, noisy data from sources
such as Twitter, and describe the crisis taxonomies that have been developed to support
the tasks and enable concept extraction. State of the art technology such as
formal concept analysis and machine learning is used to create a range of capabilities
including concept drill down, sentiment analysis, credibility assessment and
assignment of priority. We present an evaluation of results obtained from a set of
tweets which emerged from the Colorado wild fires of 2012.
1.1 Introduction
Social media data is rapidly changing the way emergency data is created and distributed
during a crisis. The proliferation of mobile devices together with ubiquitous
tools for online dissemination means that a huge pool of dynamic information is of
increasing importance to emergency personnel in a crisis situation. Crowdsourcing
can provide the fastest access to localised information and a number of studies have
suggested that emergency response can be improved by employing local community
knowledge to provide aggregated situational awareness emerging in real time
[9, 18].
However, the challenges of using such data has also been highlighted and indeed
it has been identified that social media data can be a source of misinformation, propaganda
and rumour, both intentional and unintentional [2, 16]. The obvious risks

associated with using an unregulated stream of information implies that assessing
the reliability of crowdsourced data has emerged as a crucial task [16]. Gao [11] also
points out that the level of messaging in a disaster will be so high that meaningful filtering,
aggregation, categorisation and summarisation will be essential capabilities
if we are to make effective use of the data. Narvaez [14] further argues that appropriate
organisation of social network information is the key to providing support in
terms of ground action.
The Athena project aims to harness available data from a variety of sources as
a way of extracting actionable intelligence to the public and first responders. This
is achieved by developing systems for the searching, acquisition, aggregation, filtering
and presentation of knowledge from social media and crowd-sourced data to
support crisis management. In this chapter, we describe the technology employed
at each of these stages. The raw data comes from a variety of sources and is often
challenging to process and analyse, as it is by its nature loosely structured and noisy.
Real examples are useful in development and evaluation of the tools and also in explaining
how a system works. We therefore refer to a particular data set, namely a
set of tweets transmitted during the Colorado wild fires in 2012 [17], to demonstrate
aspects of the system, such as development of the crisis taxonomy or delivering
credibility assessment.
We include and explanation of how we use and combine various commercial and
freely available open source software tools to support the tasks. We also describe
a powerful visual instrument, enabled by formal concept analysis, which we have
developed. The tool allows an analyst to drill down into the concept hierarchy which
has been established in previous stages.
1.2 Overview
In section 1.3 we begin by describing how we obtain and structure the data. We include
an explanation of the information acquisition process and the data processing
pipeline that has been established. Assessing the credibility and priority of any crisis
information is obviously a critical task. In section 1.4 we discuss the challenges
involved and the process employed in Athena, together with informative examples
from the Twitter data. In recent years the research community has been very active
in the area of sentiment analysis and it is clear that establishing the sentiment, and
any changes in sentiment from large volumes of crowd sourced information can be
extremely useful to analysts and first responders. In section 1.5 we discuss how we
track and report sentiment information and include a discussion around the supporting
taxonomy. In section 1.6 we review the use of formal concept analysis in the
data aggregation process and in section 1.7 we discuss filtering and searching.

1.3 Obtaining structured crisis data
The ATHENA Project has developed data acquisition and pre-processing tools
for the real-time acquisition of data, such as video and voice, from the social
media (both generally and from the dedicated ATHENA crisis pages) and from
mobile/high-tech devices. The ATHENA Project is characterized by an Information
Processing Process that must collect and provide robust, high quality data to
the rest of the components. This process is based on two stages. The first stage is
the acquisition and pre-processing of data in order to prepare them for analysis further
down the processing process. The second stage is based on data analysis and
aggregation.
In ATHENA, information acquisition is the process of obtaining crisis data from
a number of sources including social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter.
ATHENA will then use a number of filtering processes and crisis taxonomies
in order to focus on information that can be formulated to valuable intelligence.
Twitter is considered a valuable source of crisis data. A tweet includes a variety of
information, such as text, image, video, links and hashtags. There is also a significant
amount of metadata that characterizes each tweet. These include geo-location,
author name and Twitter handle, author pre-set location, timestamp, number of
retweets, number of favourites, list of hashtags, list of links and other users mentioned
in the tweet. ATHENA also focuses on the collection of data from stories
posted to public pages and the responses of the public to these stories. Specifically,
the analysis of the Facebook data will concentrate on the comments made on the
dedicated ATHENA crisis pages. As both Twitter and Facebook often link to external
websites, it may be useful to follow these links and crawl the content of the page
they have linked to. In some cases, this will be news reports containing standard
information but in other cases, these may contain live reports posted by journalists
that are not detected via the Twitter and Facebook crawlers or posts by individual
bloggers.
ATHENA collects crisis data also through the ATHENA Mobile Application.
There are three levels of reports that can be sent via the mobile application. These
are the public user reports, the trusted user tier-2 reports that include reports from
utilities controllers, official volunteers, and professionals from local resilience forums
and other identified credible community voices, and the trusted user tier-1
reports that include reports from first responders and from the operational, tactical
and strategic command of the Police. Data from the ATHENA Mobile Application
will include some but not necessarily all of the following: Report text, Report Image,
Report video, Report audio, Report geo-location, Report tag, Report timestamp
and User Type.
Any information which is acquired by ATHENA has to be filtered through the
SAS Information Retrieval Studio (IRS). The SAS IRS provides a data processing
pipeline that connects each of the SAS components together. It involves five main
stages. The first stage is the data import stage. This stage is related to the setting up
of crawlers for ATHENA to crawl and by inputting relevant search terms to extract
4 S. Andrews, T. Day, K. Domdouzis, L. Hirsch, R. Lefticaru, C. Orphanides
important data. The second stage is filtering. In this case, any incoming information
is evaluated for its significance based on certain criteria.
The third stage is the categorisation, context and contextual extraction phase.
This stage identifies keywords, categories and concepts in each of the post. The
fourth stage is related to the identification of any sentiment expressed in each of the
posts while the fifth stage involves the exporting of the data.
Fig. 1.1 Information Processing Pipeline
SAS provides a number of crawlers which integrate with the content categorization
studio and the sentiment analysis studio. The SAS Information Retrieval Studio
includes a web crawler which traverses the web and follows one link to the next, a
file crawler which crawls each file in a directory, a feed crawler which crawls RSS
or Atom feeds, a Google crawler, a Facebook crawler and a Twitter crawler.
Each crawler is written as a simple Python file that can be modified based on the
requirements of a crisis situation. In this case, new data sources could be added. For
the requirements of ATHENA, the Twitter crawler has been re-programmed so that
it returns the geo-location of tweets (if they are included as part of the tweets) and
the Facebook crawler has been programmatically updated so that both the public
timeline and the individual pages to be crawled.
The SAS IRS pipeline server receives documents from the crawlers. Each document
passes through filtering, categorisation and sentiment analysis and then onto
the export process. The export process can be adjusted in such a way so that specific
documents and specific data fields are exported. Categorisation in ATHENA is
based on two methods. In the first method, the document does not match any of the
concepts. In the second method, a taxonomy is developed that identifies documents
that provide crisis comments without providing crisis information. ATHENA uses
the SAS Content Categorization Studio in order to extract categories, concepts, and
contexts from the data. The SAS Content Categorization Studio is responsible for
the categorization (or provision of labels) to documents, the extraction of concepts
or in other words, the identification of particular characteristics in a document and
the identification of relationships between concepts (contextual extraction).
Categorisation is the process of analysing a document�s content and applying a
category to it based on a set of pre-defined conditions. In ATHENA, documents
can belong to a number of categories if there is match between the content of the
documents and the rules from different categories. The SAS Content Categorization
Studio offers automatic rule generation, rule writing and statistical categorisation.
Categories are built by constructing a set of Boolean rules that is applied to the incoming
documents. By connecting multiple Boolean rules, rules can be made more
complex.

A crisis taxonomy has been developed in order to categorise each collected post
into one or more categories. The list of possible crisis events has been divided into
seven types of classification: Attack, Crash, Hazard, Health, Natural Disaster, Other,
Public Order Incidents, Terrorism. Each of these classifications is sub-divided to further
categories. For example, an attack can be categorized to bomb attacks, hostages,
killings, knife attacks, lone wolf attacks, shootings, and suicide bombs.
Fig. 1.2 Example of Identified Concepts in a Tweet
Concept and contextual extraction is the process of identifying particular features
included in the document. These features may be related to keywords, particular
sentence constructs or even relationships between these features. An example of
Concept Extraction can be shown in Fig. 1.2. There is also categorisation which
is the process of analysing the contents of a document and applying a category
to it based on a set of pre-defined rules. In this case, the content of a document
6 S. Andrews, T. Day, K. Domdouzis, L. Hirsch, R. Lefticaru, C. Orphanides
may belong to different categories if their content matches rules in a number of
different categories. Categories are built based on a set of Boolean rules that are
applied to the documents that have to be categorised. The complexity of Boolean
rules also depends on whether multiple Boolean rules are combined together in order
for a number of possible scenarios to be covered. For the ATHENA project, a crisis
taxonomy has been developed which is used to categorise each post in one or more
categories. The concept extraction is used to extract more specific details from the
posts. The list of possible crisis events is roughly divided in to seven main types
of classification which are Attack, Crash, Hazard, Health, Natural Disaster, Public
Order Incidents, Terrorism, other. These incidents are then sub-divided into further
categories as shown in Figure 1.3.
Fig. 1.3 Crisis Categorisation Taxonomy
Concept extraction is very useful in the extraction of useful information from
social media data because of the wide variety of terms and spellings that refer to
the same term. The reduction of these terms to a single term ensures that there is
consistency in the analysis of the terminology. Contextual extraction is similar to
concept extraction, however the data extracted in this case are more complex in
nature and they are referred to as �facts�. Also, contextual extraction can make use
of concepts within the rules it uses.
The process terminates with the output of XML versions of the scanned documents,
containing metadata of the original documents as distinct XML elements, as
well as all identified entities extracted from the conceptual and contextual extraction
processes, as explained in the paragraphs above. Finally, through a process of data
booleanization and discretization [3], the data are transformed into formal contexts,
making the data accessible by the knowledge discovery and intuitive, conceptual
visualization techniques [4] of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). For an overview of
FCA see section 1.6.

1.4 Assessing credibility and priority
According to the Oxford dictionary, credibility is �the quality of being trusted
and believed in, the quality of being convincing or believable�. One objective of
Athena project is to develop tools and techniques �to automatically assess information/
information sources for credibility and maliciousness� and in order to achieve
this and further prioritize the information received, we are focused on two targets:
detecting credible and in the same time providing situational awareness information,
in the context of a possible emergency crisis.
The overall information credibility is calculated based on knowledge of: (i) the
information provider, when the report author is known, for example if he/she is a
registered key user, an official volunteer or first responder; (ii) the text, on which
classification techniques are applied to assess the content credibility and informativeness;
and (iii) the context, meaning the content and corroboration of the information:
more messages reporting the same incident, previously reported and already
validated, will contribute to increasing the credibility and automatic validation of
new incoming messages on the same topic.
In the following, as we are working with data received from different sources
and which was communicated via different channels and contexts, we will present
our approaches to automate the detection of credible and informative crises related
messages. As detailed in Section 1.3, the information received by Athena Crisis
Command & Control Intelligence Dashboard (CCCID), which has been described
in [8], has different sources: the Athena mobile application, but also social media
sources such as Twitter, Facebook, or RSS feeds.
For assessing the credibility of data coming from these two main streams, we
have developed slightly different approaches, depending on the information source.
First, the messages received from the Athenamobile app belong to the following categories:
(a) general public reports, for example from anonymous users; (b) trusted
user tier-2 reports, e.g. from official volunteers, professionals, and (c) trusted user
tier-1 reports, received from first responders, operational, tactical and strategic command
of Police. The messages and reports of type (b), (c) have a higher importance
during the crisis, they could potentially present useful details, warnings or important
actions to be taken, so they have a higher priority.
All the general public messages received from the mobile app (potentially from
anonymous users) will be evaluated by human operators and they can be validated or
rejected using Athena CCCID. A help message will be validated if it seems credible
or genuine, otherwise it can be rejected, for example in case of people misusing the
application, sending any kind of non-emergency or not relevant text, with or without
malicious intentions. A semi-supervised machine learning algorithm will assist the
human operators in the message classification, suggesting if the message should be
validated or rejected, in case it does not seem to be a genuine message, sent from a
user in an emergency situation. The automatic label proposed by the algorithm will
not be definitive, it could be modified by the operators. If a message is incorrectly
classified by the algorithm, then a human operator can change its classification.
After such a modification the labelled message will be added to the training set of
8 S. Andrews, T. Day, K. Domdouzis, L. Hirsch, R. Lefticaru, C. Orphanides
the machine learning algorithm, this one being able adjust itself in the future and
have a better prediction next time when receiving a similar example.
Apart from the data received from the Athena mobile app, there are also messages
or documents retrieved from social media, for example from crawling Twitter
or Facebook, which have been detected as possibly describing an emerging crisis
situation. For this second case we propose an automatic classification, using supervised
machine learning techniques, the methodology to be followed is detailed in
Section 1.4.1.
Apart from assessing the credibility of the received messages, another important
task is to automatically prioritize them. To the best of our knowledge, there are only
a few attempts in the literature and these are concerned with the crisis situations
generated by floods, the proposed method is a geographical prioritization of social
network messages using sensor data streams [5]. The approach is based on analysing
previous data and observing the correlation between the number of Twitter messages
near flood affected areas, which is much higher than in other areas [1, 5], and suggesting
the combination of geographical data from the gauging stations with social
media to prioritize and improve situational awareness during floods.
For the moment the Athena CCCID has a prioritization mechanism based on
users tiers - different levels of trust within the Athena mobile application. However,
this new approach of combining geodata with social media could be very useful
when sensor data streams from the authorities are available and it worths being
investigated in other cases of natural disasters, e.g. earthquakes.
1.4.1 Credibility assessment of Twitter messages
There has been an increasing trend in the last decade for people to report ongoing
crisis situations via Twitter, which could contribute to situational awareness and
could eventually help the Law-Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), police and first responders.
However, the huge amount of messages transmitted via Twitter or other
social media makes it impossible for human operators to manually cull and extract
relevant information in emergency situation. Consequently, it emerged the necessity
of using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques
for automating the extraction of situational awareness information broadcasted
via social media [7, 19, 21].
This justifies the development of appropriate classifiers for detecting credible
messages and this problem has been studied by many researchers in an off-line (or
post-hoc) setting, using data gathered from previous high impact situation to train
the classifiers.
The majority of researchers focused on analysing Twitter data obtained via Twitter
API, which seems to be easier to access compared to Facebook data which is
subject to different privacy rules. Datasets of tweets transmitted during high impact
crisis, have been collected, downloaded and labelled in order to serve as training and
test sets for the classifiers. An example of tweets transmitted during the Colorado

fires in 2012 is given in Table 1.1, the keywords which might relate them to the
crises are emphasized, however the personal data, such as name or usernames, has
been hidden from ethical reasons. The table contains different tweets which were
labelled in the study [17] into different categories or classes such as: related and
informative; not related; not applicable; related but not informative.
In Fig. 1.4 we present an overview of our research approach, aiming to apply ML
(more precisely supervised learning) and NLP techniques in order to build a classifier
to assess the credibility and information awareness of social media messages
sent during crises situations. The first step, data collection, consists in obtaining the
appropriate datasets and labelling them1, this meaning annotating each record with
the class to which it belongs. The collection we considered for training consists
of a labelled dataset of 1200 tweets extracted from those sent during the Colorado
wildfires (2012), which is presented in [17].

In the machine learning process, the simple text is not enough for training; that is
why for each tweet other features are extracted or computed, representing attributes
which might be relevant for establishing the credibility and message informativeness.
The features computed for each tweet could be grouped into different scopes
as in [6]:
 Message related: length of the text of the tweet (in characters); number of words;
fraction of capital letters in the tweet; number of URLs contained on a tweet;
mentions a user (e.g. @username); includes a hashtag (e.g. #HighParkFire);
 User related: registration age (time passed since the author registered his/her
account, in days); statuses count (number of tweets at posting time); number
of people following this author at posting time; number of friends (number of
people this author is following at posting time); if the user has a verified account;
 Topic: number of tweets, average length;
 Propagation: number of re-tweets, degree of the root in a propagation tree etc.
The list above is not exhaustive, there are authors using larger sets, containing for
example 45 features [12], in order to determine the credibility of a tweet. There are
also studies showing which features are the better indicators of credibility and occur
more often in data describing emergency situations [15]. For a detailed survey of
existing research and tools developed for processing social media messages in mass
emergency [13] can be consulted.
However, for privacy issues and other concerns regarding personal data we did
not employ any user related features (such as number of friends / followers on Twitter)
and we focused mainly on the message related attributes. It is worth mentioning
that in the feature selection we have also considered the results provided by
SAS Sentiment Analysis Studio, which provides classification into positive, negative,
neutral, or unclassified as detailed in Section 1.5 and the number of identified
concepts (see Fig. 1.2) and crisis related concepts which have been extracted from
the text, according to the taxonomy presented in Fig. 1.3.
After processing the appropriate features for each record in the training dataset,
the third stage of the process is the machine learning and here we have been experimenting
with different ML algorithms, which are implemented in WEKA software
[20], e.g. AdaBoost, naive Bayes, Bayesian Networks, IBk, decision trees like J48,
decision table etc. Currently we are performing comparisons between these algorithms,
in order to choose the ones which are more appropriate for our problem, one
particular algorithm providing good performance for the current dataset is J48, an
algorithm used to generate a decision tree.
The forth step consists in evaluating the classifier which has been developed
against new data sets or against the same data set, but on examples which have
not been used at training, the most common approach is using a 10-fold cross validation
strategy. The approach we have presented is currently in the evaluation phase
and after this it will be integrated in the Athena tools. Currently the accuracy of the
classifier is around 80%, however it could be improved if other features, such as
those user related, would be taking into account.

1.5 Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is used to categorize and classify the opinions and sentiments
expressed in the Colorado wildfire Twitter dataset. We have used SAS Sentiment
Analysis Studio to capture the polarity of the text: whether the expressed opinion
in a tweet, a particular sentence of the tweet, or an entity feature/aspect is positive,
negative, or neutral. The following polarity classes were implemented:
 positive � a positive sentiment has been expressed
 negative � a negative sentiment has been expressed
 neutral � a neutral sentiment has been expressed
 unclassified � the sentiment expressed does not fall in any of the defined polarity
classes
The polarity of each document is measured at both the overall document level
(i.e. expressed towards the Colorado wildfires crisis event), and, when applicable,
at the specific feature level (i.e. sentiment explicitly expressed towards an entity
involved in the crisis event). This is possible through the creation of multi-level
taxonomies to assess sentiment, as explained in the sub-section below.
1.5.1 Sentiment Taxonomy
The ATHENA sentiment taxonomy utilizes a hybrid model, comprising of both statistical
methods and predefined sentiment vocabularies, as well as handcrafted rules,
custom-tailored to crisis events. These rules comprise of term matching, regular expressions
and part-of-speech tags, along with pre-built Boolean operators expressing
constraints, such as the distance and occurrence of concepts in relation to other
words.
Fig. 1.5 The ATHENA sentiment analysis model (partial screenshot)
Figure 1.5 shows some of the custom-built predicate rules defined for the purposes
of ATHENA, which allow for the definition of semantic relationships between
12 S. Andrews, T. Day, K. Domdouzis, L. Hirsch, R. Lefticaru, C. Orphanides
concepts (i.e. entities). The left column displays some of the concepts which are
usually identified in crisis management situations, such as citizens, first responders
and law enforcement agencies. Each entity can have it�s own set of rules, allowing
for contextual identification of sentiment; the fourth rule, for example, looks for
instances of the fire service concept combined with words expressing positive sentiment,
in the same sentence, having a maximum distance of five words between the
two.
1.5.2 An Example
Figure 1.6 shows a partial example of the sentiment identified in the Colorado wildfires
Twitter dataset. The overall sentiment of each document (tweet) is expressed in
the first column. When sentiment has been identified for specific concepts in each
document, it is expressed in the third column. The fourth row contains the actual
body of each tweet, which has been purposefully truncated for ethical purposes.
Inspecting the results of the first row, for example, shows how an overall positive
sentiment was identified for that particular tweet, but also how the positive sentiment
was expressed towards the Colorado fire service, which evidently handled the
crisis successfully. In fact, out of the 1200 tweet corpus, a majority of the sentiment
expressed towards governmental entities such as the fire service and the military has
been positive.
Fig. 1.6 An example of identified sentiment in the Colorado wildfires Twitter dataset
1.6 Aggregation to reduce information overload
In a crisis situation, decision makers need a clear picture of the events occurring.
It is no use being overloaded with information from hundreds or even thousands of
1 Analysing Crowd-Sourced Information and Social Media for Crisis Management 13
sources, which may well be the case if social media and citizen reporting are being
used to obtain information. Thus the ATHENA system has a process to aggregate
sources when they contain information about the same event, greatly reducing the
number of information points presented to the decision maker. Furthermore, this aggregation
can give an indication of the size, seriousness and credibility of the event
simply by the number of sources involved (although the number of corroborating
sources should not, of course, be relied upon as the only measure of these factors).
In ATHENA this aggregation is carried out by a clustering technique called Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA) [10].
A formal description of formal concepts begins with a set of objects G and a set
of attributes M. A binary relation I  GM is called the formal context. If i 2 G
and j 2 M then iI j says that object i has attribute j. For a set of objects A  G, a
derivation operator 0 is defined to obtain the set of attributes common to the objects
in A as follows:
A0 := f j 2 M j 8i 2 A : iI j g.
Similarly, for a set of attributes B  M, the operator is defined to obtain the set
of objects common to the attributes in B as follows:
B0 := f i 2 G j 8 j 2 B : iI j g.
(A;B) is a formal concept iff A0 =B and B0 =A. Thus A and B have the following
properties: (i) Every object in A has every attribute in B, (ii) For every object in G
that is not in A, there is an attribute in B that that object does not have, and (iii) For
every attribute in M that is not in B there is an object in A that does not have that
attribute.
In ATHENA, the information sources are the objects and the structured data extracted
from them are their attributes. Thus an object might have attributes such as a
location, a crisis category, a sentiment, a date and time and so on. If the aggregated
information is to be presented to the decision maker via a map of the crisis area, we
can define a �crisis concept� as being a formal concept that contains at least one location
and a least one crisis category. Thus FCA has been implemented in ATHENA
to compute crisis concepts from the structured data obtained from the social media
and citizen reporter information sources.
The Colorado wildfire Twitter data provides an example of this and Figure 1.7
shows part of a formal concept tree generated from the structured data obtained
from the Tweets. Each node is a formal concept and the node on the left represent
the set of 642 Tweets that have a location and a crisis category in their text. Each
of the numbered nodes on the right is a �crisis concept� containing a location and
a crisis category. The label above each node contains the attributes of the concept
and the label below gives the number of Tweets sharing those attributes. If a node is
filled in, it means there are further specialised �sub-concepts� that can be explored -
containing fewer Tweets but a greater number of shared attributes.
Figure 1.8 shows on of the filled in nodes expanded to reveal its sub-concepts.
Each sub-concept inherits the attributes of the �parent� concept but has additional
attributes potentially containing more valuable information about the crisis. In the
14 S. Andrews, T. Day, K. Domdouzis, L. Hirsch, R. Lefticaru, C. Orphanides
example, there is a group of Tweets that mention a shooting attack and two groups
mentioning a fire or wildfire. There are also groups of Tweets containing negative
sentiment.
Fig. 1.7 Crisis Concepts computed from the Colorado Tweets
The analyst/decision maker also has the ability to trace back Tweets of interest to
the original source. The crisis concepts, instead of displaying the number of Tweets
can display the source URLs. The analyst can select a URL to link back to the
original text.
Thus, the application of FCA to aggregate source information into �crisis concepts�
facilitates the decision maker by reducing information overload and focusing
on crisis information along with its location. In ATHENA the usability and interpretation
is further improved by displaying crisis concepts in a map-based interface
with additional filtering and search facilities.

1.7 Filtering and Searching
This section discusses the considerations and approaches to providing command and
control operators with the necessary data they need in order to carry out their roles in
a crisis situation when using the Athena Crisis Command and Control Intelligence
Dashboard (CCCID).
There are various design considerations that should be made when providing
filtering and searching capability and what could be arbitrarily applied depending
on the role of the individual user or need. Two distinct phases of the crisis may also
be recognised, which are during the time of the crisis, where information is more
important in a relative context to the current situation, and the post-crisis phase
where in depth analysis and visualisation has its importance.
1.7.1 Design Considerations
With a system such as the Athena CCCID being widely deployed, at any level, there
is likely to be a large amount of data generated at any given time. This is simply
due to the link between scale and distribution of crises, i.e. small crises occur often
whilst large crises occur infrequently. As a result, the data flows in Athena could be
reasonably steady. The Athena consortium has found the following considerations
to be of importance, particularly in the scope of crisis management.
Geographical Location
Clearly, it is of great importance that the geographical location of any report coming
in from the general public, is available and as accurate as possible. Much of this
also depends on the scale of the Athena deployment. Where Athena is deployed, for
instance, d on a national scale, it would be feasible to have various groups or teams
16 S. Andrews, T. Day, K. Domdouzis, L. Hirsch, R. Lefticaru, C. Orphanides
of operators monitoring and responding to particular geographical regions, just as
call handlers and first responders would in any emergency response. With appropriate
arbitrary filtering on geographical boundaries in place, a national deployment
would result in similar behaviour to a regional or even international deployment.
In such a scenario, it would be important for operators to be effectively registered
or operational for only a subset of the reports and response in Athena - whilst there
may be more strategic overviews at a higher level. Consideration should also be
made in that there may be local and hyper-local responders using the mobile app
or even the Athena CCCID (voluntary organisations, neighbourhood watch, private
sector security) who may require a geographically restricted view of activity.
Validity, Credibility and Priority
It is occasionally the case that misinformation, or even disinformation, may be propagated
throughout a system such as Athena for various reasons (hoax, malicious,
political) which is why the validity and credibility of incoming reports should be assessed.
This may be a manual process though could be made automated in various
ways with varying results.
In Athena, the focus with regards to validity and credibility is primarily on the
source of the information, or user tier, which ranges from a full access operator level
user, right down to an unregistered member of the general public. Both, validity
and credibility assessment or recommendations can be achieved based on whether
other information has already been validated or rejected by the CCCID operators.
The benefit of this comparative approach is the reduced risk of invading individual
privacy.
Priority is slightly different in that it enables the system or operators to carry out
validity and credibility assessment in the most efficient manner possible. The use of
a triage approach to priority would focus the manual workload of the operators only
on the most important tasks first.
Due to the risk of misinformation and disinformation enter the system, avoiding
such abuse could be achieved through legislation supporting for individual registration
for use or the automatic sharing of identity information by telecommunications
companies when interacting with the system.
Information Source
Identifying the source of incoming information could be employed to aid the operators
and automation processes with validation, credibility and priority. An example
of this may be an individual interacting directly with the Athena mobile app which
is an ambiguous step, whereas information coming in from social media is more
likely to be misinterpreted. This classification should be available to the operator.

Free-Text Searchability
Any incoming bodies unstructured text should be indexed appropriately to enable
free-text search of the system. This should also work in combination with all other
filtering options, giving the operator the power to find information within information.
The difference between free-text search and all other types of filtering is that
there is often no reason as to why it would be arbitrarily applied (in the same way
that an operator whose role is validation, may need to see only reports that have not
been validated yet).
Information Aggregation
Due to the potentially steady, though sizable streams of information entering a system
like Athena from uncontrolled sources, it makes sense and may even been vital
in many and all situations that information is properly aggregated. Athena does this
on-the-fly using a formal concept analysis algorithm. Though it doesn�t stop at the
actual aggregation process as operators need to be able to choose between accessing
individual reports or aggregated reports to ensure information is not missed or even
to validate the aggregation process. The reduction in information flow here can be
highly beneficial, for example, there may be fifteen reports representing the same
instance with slight variations, showing the operator one report instead of fifteen
will greatly improve their efficiency.
1.7.2 During Crisis
As a crisis in unfolding, operators are unlikely to need functionality that provides
them with full exploratory access to the Athena data set. Data needs to be geographically
and temporally relevant to the individual operator and delivered in a way that
enables them to carry out necessary responsibilities. Considering the types of filtering
and searching capabilities discussed, some are more important during a crisis.
First of all, is location. If an operator doesnt have any information regarding the
location of those reporting the crisis, it makes their job extremely difficult or even
impossible. Though this is less of a challenge when more information is coming in
as aggregation can help with this, i.e. a report regarding a vehicle crash in location
A, could potentially be aggregated with other reports at a similar time regarding a
car fire.
Such aggregation, or even association between multiple incoming reports with
various information is difficult without considering the time information came in.
During a crisis, it is more important for operators to see time in a relative way, such
as �4 minutes ago�. Using time in this way and allowing operators to find data based
on the last number of seconds, minutes or hours can increase the speed in which they
filter through information.

The three points of validity, credibility and priority are all quite similar, but serve
their individual purposes and complement one another. These classifiers can be used
by operators to change their perspective of the incoming information, i.e. see the
current certain and uncertain state of the situation.
Finally, it is important due to the potential for information overload, the provide
operators with the least data as possible. As Athena employs aggregation processes
to identify, combine and corroborate incoming information, it enables operators to
see and react to a more generalised picture of the unfolding crisis.
1.7.3 Post Crisis
The needs of the accessing data post-crisis are distinct from at the time of the crisis.
At this time the view is both highly generalised whilst requiring greater detail
and interrogation capabilities. It is at this stage where data visualisation is likely to
provide most value. That said, location and time are still key players.
The element that is more vital with regards to searchability at this stage is with
crisis media. Having the ability to quickly and easily visualise and traverse all media
captured during the crisis is important for gathering a picture of the entire crisis and
its response. This can easily be timelined, as could the entire incident or particular
geographical regions.
Timeline visualisations can provide an insight into both when media was captured,
likely revealing when key events occurred. They can also provide access to
the pace at which new information came into the system at key stages during the
crisis (i.e. in an earthquake situation these key events could be initial incident and
aftershocks as well as building collapses) to provide an overview of the crisis.
Auditing all data, updates and activities in the Athena system, whether internally
or externally invoked is extremely important for analysis the crisis as well as the
response to the crisis. Every individual piece of data that enters the system should
be recorded in a write-only audit. Every modification to the data or its state should
also be record. The end goal here is ensuring that no piece of data goes missing, i.e.
removing data from the CCCID may be possible, but the audit will not miss anything.
Visualising and analysis such data can provide valuable insights and lessons
into the crisis but also the use of the mobile app and CCCID.
1.8 Results and Evaluation
Overall we can report some success in the processes we have developed when applied
to the social media data from a real disaster. Our results also point to a number
of promising lines for future development.
The main objective for the automated aggregation of information sources was to
reduce information overload. In the example using the Colorado Tweets, the original
1 Analysing Crowd-Sourced Information and Social Media for Crisis Management 19
1200 Tweets were firstly reduced to 642 by only considering those that contained
a location and a reference to a crisis category. The FCA aggregation reduced this
to 76 groups of Tweets, each group containing Tweets with the same location and
crisis category. This represents a significant reduction in information points (88%)
and, in this case, a final number of information points that would be manageable
by an end user. However, if the starting point was a far greater number of information
sources, additional steps may have to be taken to counter information overload,
such as setting a minimum number of information sources per crisis concept. Better
resolution of location names would also increase the level of aggregation and
improve the quality of the crisis concepts. In the Colorado Tweets, there were nine
�versions� of Colorado Springs: Help Colorado Springs, Fame Colorado Springs,
Colorado Springs, COLORADO SPRINGS, Davis Colorado Springs, Northwestern
Colorado Springs, Technician Colorado Springs, The Colorado Springs and Hey
Colorado Springs. Further work is required in improve the location recognition and
extraction software to resolve identical locations and exclude erroneous locations.
The Colorado Tweets example also illustrated the abillity of a crisis taxonomy
in providing a useful �drill-down� feature for the analyst. Figure 1.8 shows crisis
concepts with increasingly specialised crisis categories, from TYPES OF CRISIS
to NATURAL DISASTER to ND-WILDFIRE. The higher levels of aggregation are
achieved at the more general levels in the taxonomy, but the analyst is able to then
�drill-down� into ever more specialised sub-concepts that have fewer information
sources but potentially more specific information about a specific crisis event. The
most specialised concept may contain only a few information sources and at this
point the analyst is able to trace back to the original sources to examine their text.
The sentiment analysis component identified sentiment correctly in more than
87% of the tweet corpus, while the reamining 13% showed how the analysis would
benefit from further sentiment specialisation. For example, in some instances, the
sentiment analysis component identified negative sentiments expressed towards citizens.
Upon manual inspection, these tweets were actually expressing emotions such
as sadness, anger and frustration towards the crisis event � this shows how further
insight could be gained by extending the sentiment model to incorporate specialized
sentiments such as anger and frustration, in the analysis, rather than only using the
positive/negative scale.
1.9 Conclusion
Crowdsourcing and other online participatory practices are becoming increasingly
important to emergency personnel. The benefits of harnessing social media data and
the faster, localised information from technology enabling mass participation are
significant. However, the risks and challenges of using such large pools of dynamic,
unregulated material cannot be ignored. Here, we have reviewed the benefits and
potential dangers of exploiting this information. We have discussed various tools
such as sentiment analysis, credibility assessment and priority assessment which
20 S. Andrews, T. Day, K. Domdouzis, L. Hirsch, R. Lefticaru, C. Orphanides
aim to enhance the usefulness and reliability of the data and contribute to emergency
assessment and response.
In this chapter we have given an overview of the processes and systems used
in Athena as a means obtaining, analysing, filtering and presenting social media
and crowd-sourced information. The result of this work is a set of powerful new
capabilities which can be used in multiple ways to support the overall goals of the
Athena project.
